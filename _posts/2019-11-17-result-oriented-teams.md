Team members are often chosen for the wrong reasons: for example, they are often chosen because they have an interest in the project, because their wage is affordable, or most often simply because they are available. They are not chosen with objective actualization in mind. This brings to attention the need for developing a team formation structure that is focused on optimal output. **Structuring teams for optimal output are at the core of the Result Driven Team Methodology**

Adopting from the (OKR Playbook)[https://weekdone.com/resources/objectives-key-results] (Objectives and Key Results), a popular management strategy for goal setting within organizations driven by connecting companies, teams and personal goals to measurable results while having all team members and leaders work together in one, unified direction.

### What are Objective Driven Team Structures

The first consideration in organizing a team is to determine the team's broad objective. Here are the broad objectives according to Larson and LaFasto 

• Problem resolution
• Creativity
• Tactical execution

Once you've established the broad objective, you choose a team structure that matches it. Larson and LaFasto define three general team structures for effective, high-performance team

It takes more than just a group of people who happen to work together to constitute a team. In thek book The Wisdom of Teams, Katzenbach and Smith (1993) define a team as "a small number of people with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose, performance goals, and approach for which they hold themselves mutually accountable." Teamwork can come into play on software projects on any number of spescific tasks.

### **Objective driven teams are result driven teams and have essential characteristics**

From Steve's (Rapid Development)[www.AMAZON_LINK.com], there are four essential characteristics of a results-driven team structure:

- Roles must be clear, and everyone must be accountable for their work at all times. Accountability is critical to effective decision making and to rapid execution after the decisions have been made.
- The team must have an effective communication system that supports the free flow of information among team members. Communication must flow freely both from and to the team's management.
- The team must have some means of monitoring individual performance and providing feedback. The team should know whom to reward, who needs  individual development, and who can assume more responsibilities in the future.
- Decisions must be made based on facts rather than on subjective opinions whenever possible. The team needs to be sure that the facts are interpreted without biases that undercut the functioning of the team.
- There is a strong desire to contribute among team members of Objective Driven teams
- Team members are committed to the team
- There is an indentifiable level of inter-dependence among team members - team members learn to rely on each other to accomplish certain tasks and goals
- A sense of Autonomy among team members, with little to no interference, according to research, when there is a problem instead of managers taking it upon themselves to punish or solve these issues, they should rather walk by the side of the teams to point them in the right direction for how to go about their blocks or productivity conflict
- Strong sense of Empowerment among team members, Team members feel like they have the power to use up the resources and privileges available to them for the benefit of the team, Learning from the rework project, Google gives their engineers access to their codebase which is worth an incredible wealth of knowledge for new engineers to explore and make input into the processes at the heart of the organization.
- High level of enjoyment, in Objective Driven teams, due to the massive gains of accomplished goals and milestones, team members tend to take happiness seriously.

## Achieving Objective Driven Team Structures

- Manage Teams as Teams
- In team selection, ensure there is a blend of technical, business, management and inter-personal skills, of course this would vary across various disciplines and not only apply to the world or business or startups.
- Ensure that team members obtain specific soft skills, or collaboration skills required to work effectively with others, if communications is aligned with slack or issues are traiged with github, team leads and managers should ensure that all team members are fully acquainted with the resource and knowledge to use these tools and frameworks in order to streamline communication and collaboration.

### This call for the need for result driven team structures, so what are these, result driven teams are driven by a common goal and vision and are invested in the same amount of work and tide, so they work on how to make things.

In conclusion, a lot of reading can try to point you to the right direction as to how to achieve this goals, I decided to highlight these characteristics so that you as team members can identify the state of your team and take action.
