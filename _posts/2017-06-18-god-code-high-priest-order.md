title: How God Coded the High Priest Order
tag: journal

<pre>Hebrew 7-10</pre>
<p>Prayer used to have a version one in the old testament, all protocols went through the high priest into the inner chamber who them dispatched(prayer.actions) into heaven. In this model prayer was a single threaded protocol. </p>

<p>Then Jesus Jesus came it was no longer single threaded through a High Priest. We all had access to the <code>window.top</code> and could speak with the Father (trinity), Jesus christ gave us access to the the event listeners in the DOM, and now we could send our requests directly to the father, more importantly we all stack our events to heaven in a multi threaded fashion, faster than the V8 Engine in <a href="https://nodejs.com">NodeJS</a>

<p>Well, this is just a thought and don't take me serious, in some way i think God is the father of Programmers, and he has replicated everything we ever want to think of in software into the processes in humanity. </p>
