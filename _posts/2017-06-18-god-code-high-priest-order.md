<p>If Prayer had version control, we can argue that the alpha edition were experienced in the old testament, all protocols went through the high priest into the inner chamber who them <code>dispatched(prayer.actions)</code> through <a href="#">api.heaven</a>. In this model prayer was a single threaded protocol. </p>

<pre>Hebrew 7-10</pre>

<p>Then Jesus Jesus came it was no longer single threaded through a High Priest. We all had access to the <code>{Global}</code> Object and could speak with the Father (trinity), Jesus christ gave us access to the the event listeners in the <b>HOM (Heaven Object Model)</b>, and now we could send our requests directly to the father, more importantly we can stack our events to heaven in a multi threaded fashion, faster than the V8 Engine in <a href="https://nodejs.com">NodeJS</a>

<p>Well, this is wild thought and you should have an open mind, in some way I think God is the father of Programmers, and he has replicated everything we ever want to think of in software into the processes in humanity. </p>
