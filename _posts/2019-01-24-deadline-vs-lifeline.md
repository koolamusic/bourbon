We are stuck goals and milestones in a modern age, where everything is moving fast and millenials are expected to meet very high expectations, this is not our point though

Have you ever given a developer a job to do for you with an ETA. this applies to most creatives, artist, music producers, carpenters etc.

Are you a **deadline** or **lifeline** person : 
This comparison will help you find out


### Deadline
- sticks to the timeline and delivers before time
- Sticks to a particular process/strategy and gracefully follows it through 

### Lifeline
- Good at emergency deliveries, tight delivery expectations
- Hacks processes to produces optimal results, most cases short term.


This makes me reflect between Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, two wonderful personalites, winners they are, however I would categorize one as a Lifeline person and another one as a deadline person

In the startup world, you require a mix of both, roll out a feature immediately, so that the VC and users would be happy, experiencing the potential of that feature, then gradually iterating through the process to optimize and fine tune delivery and results. 

Who are you ? Deadline : Lifeline
