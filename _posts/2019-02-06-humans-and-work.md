<p>We work every day, somehow it seems like most of us were wired this way, some say the hustle is real or the struggle is, you can define yours anyway. If it isn't toiling with engines and machines, making glue stick, talking your way into people's heart or speeding across geographical boundaries, for some it's transversing needle and thread across the epidermis, writing our way into the thought patterns of industries, fields, and organizations.</p>

<p>We work, we achieve milestones, celebrate victories, and get rewarded duly, sometimes we have to deal with nasty bugs <em>(error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result)</em> every now and then.</p>

<p>But no matter what, we try our best to do the best work we can and be the best out there so whatever it is your hand finds to do, do it with pride, make the best out of it and cherish every moment you do that.</p>
