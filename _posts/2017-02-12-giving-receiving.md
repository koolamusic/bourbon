Why is it easy for people to give when they have or most likely give with an expectation to receive, this is very popular within the African continent especially in Nigeria, that is why folks can invest in schemes like zarfund, mmm, ultimatecycle and the rest of them, because they have been promised to gain back how much they give with even a lot more profit.

There is no crime in giving with an expectation, but giving because you perceive you'll attain an advantage in what you would receive could be somewhat dubious, this has caused a lot of institutions (religious) to exploit this demeanour.

* Why do you give ?
* Why do you share ?
* What do you expect in return ?
