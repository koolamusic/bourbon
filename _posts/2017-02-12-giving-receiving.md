Why is it easy for people to give when they have or most likely give with an expectation to receive, this is very popular among the African community especially in Nigeria, that is why folks can invest in schemes like zarfund, mmm, ultimatecycle and the rest of them, because they know they will receive. 

There is no crime in giving with an expectation, but giving because you perceive you'll attain an advantage in what you would receive could be somewhat dubious, this has caused a lot of institutions (religious) to exploit this demeanour.
