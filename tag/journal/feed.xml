      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/boiled-plantain">&lt;p&gt;Not so early this morning I had breakfast, not the usual kind but before we get to that let’s talk about the period before this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had harvested a bunch of plantain from the farm few days ago, unripe as they were, some had begun to get ripe, and today we had only one ripe plantain from the fold, my junior sister favour, the amazing chef at &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.facebook.com/besoma-kitchen&quot;&gt;Besoma Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; had decided she was going to preserve it till later today to make some Fri-ta-tas, while I hungry as I was this morning, saw the plantain as an opportunity to make a really nice breakfast combo of white rice, some boiled plaintain and vegetable sauce; not knowing about favour’s intention, I quickly did as my imagination had pieced together for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cut the plantain and made my combo; favour coming into the kitchen seeing my actions, then screamed and said oooohhh I should have hidden it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes of course she should have, just like every entrepreneur should patent their idea, register their company and probably not wait for that time they think is best to initialize and start building their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never wait because some hungry fellow from anywhere in the world or your brother could come in and do something with the idea, raw material, available opportunity you had and solve a similar problem be it (breakfast, lunch or dinner); the world is alway better without hunger :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So trust me you are better off starting now, and I mean right now, go back to that Kanban board or whatever and push that card to the in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And lest I forget to mention, I ended up sharing my combo with favour.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="/posts/should-you-dive-into-html">&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with someone recently who’s building their first website for a paying client. He’s doing extremely well, grappling with setting up hosting, domain names, CMS templates, Twig &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; HTML and CSS. That’s a lot to simply learn. Producing something that’s someone’s willing to pay for while you learn is doubly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing he was particularly frustrated about was receiving various files that he was expected to build web pages from. They might be Photoshop generated images or (a lot more usefully) Sketch wireframes. It’s a kind of baptism by fire – or by jQuery – where you try and wrangle something that &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like something else that’s constructed differently, and serves a different purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I built sites for paying customers I was lucky, I think. I got work on the back of this website, and I suspect it’s pretty obvious you’re not going to get complex, poster-like layouts and effects from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this site sets expectations nicely. I’ve also found that it’s important for the developer to control the conversation about what’s being built. And the only way to do that is to &lt;em&gt;start building HTML as soon as possible in the process&lt;/em&gt; for comment and approval. Once the customer (or someone in your team) produces a PNG and asks you to &lt;em&gt;translate&lt;/em&gt; it to HTML, you’re either going to have to have a “difficult conversation” or spend your time pushing pixels and reaching for more and more javascript or abstruse, difficult CSS in order to wrangle your screen into the right shape. Responsiveness, manageability and speed become afterthoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say something like a Photoshop-generated image doesn’t have its place as it can express things like tone, colour, mood and typography succinctly. Wireframes get you thinking about UI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
