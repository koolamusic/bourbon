        <title>What is your occupation ?</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;We work every day, somehow it seems like most of us were wired this way, some say the hustle is real or the struggle is, you can define yours anyway. If it isn't toiling with engines and machines, making glue stick, talking your way into people's heart or speeding across geographical boundaries, for some it's transversing needle and thread across the epidermis, writing our way into the thought patterns of industries, fields, and organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Managing Christmas Depression</title>
        
          <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Christmas is almost a week away and like they say, depression is tough at the best of times. Perhaps it’s the best of times as the holiday/season of Christmas is when it’s especially tough.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Should you dive into HTML or else</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was chatting with someone recently who’s building their first website for a paying client. He’s doing extremely well, grappling with setting up hosting, domain names, CMS templates, Twig &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; HTML and CSS. That’s a lot to simply learn. Producing something that’s someone’s willing to pay for while you learn is doubly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How God Coded the High Priest Order</title>
        
          <description>&lt;pre&gt;Hebrew 7-10&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer used to have a version one in the old testament, all protocols went through the high priest into the inner chamber who them dispatched(prayer.actions) into heaven. In this model prayer was a single threaded protocol. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Giving with expectation</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Why is it easy for people to give when they have or most likely give with an expectation to receive, this is very popular among the African community especially in Nigeria, that is why folks can invest in schemes like zarfund, mmm, ultimatecycle and the rest of them, because they know they will receive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Measuring experience</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyone thinks &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; is important. After all, the argument goes, the ultimate reason for using any service is to experience something, whether that’s a sense of wonder and excitement when you discover something new, enjoyment at some particularly interesting writing or, more prosaically, a sense of relief at paying an overdue bill.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Businessman &amp; The Fisherman</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.&lt;/p&gt;
