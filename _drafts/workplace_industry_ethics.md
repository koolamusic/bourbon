Industry ethics, **Are you playing by the rules of your industry.**

It is better to be a smart criminal than a clueless one. 

Sometime in 2016 I built the Temkinsky projecct ===> Story about the contract 
Then later last year, while doing a search audit on my company TECMIE, I found this story. Temkinsky paid well but something was off according to this post. 

If i was taken unawares, I could have been an accomplice to a crime I know nothing about. This caused a streak of carefulness within me and i decided that we werent goinng to fall prey. 


Early in 2018 a shadow company had come to meet us based on recommendation from a previous client that they needed a platform on the blockchain, 
So we go into the product development phase, Research, Design, Mockups and Project Task breakdown, and what was more important to the core team was the ICO platform.

We know how these have been in 2018, ICO platforms with whitepapers and propositions about imaginary ideas not implemented, I did trust the Founder as i approved his all rpound wisdom within the blockchain ecocsystem 
But i did have my doubts about his two partners and these gave me serious concerns, after digging deep, 
I realized that they were solemnly up to no GOOD. 


We dissolved our agreements and later on, shadow company went on to launch an ICO. 
Till date their is no product or MVP. 


As an agency it is important to us to be able to share the work we've done and tell stories of their success which should outlive us. Working on stuff like that takes away our most valuable resource. TIME for doing nothing. 


More importantly know the bounds of your industry and if you were to cross the boundary ethically. do it with intention and understanding of what you're getting into.
