# How to know you are focusing

    Clear goals that, while challenging, are still attainable
    Strong concentration and focused attention
    The activity is intrinsically rewarding
    Feelings of serenity; a loss of feelings of self-consciousness
    Timelessness; a distorted sense of time; feeling so focused on the present that you lose track of time passing
    Immediate feedback
    Knowing that the task is doable; a balance between skill level and the challenge presented
    Feelings of personal control over the situation and the outcome
    Lack of awareness of physical needs
    Complete focus on the activity itself



## Benefits of achieving Focus


    Flow can lead to improved performance. Researchers have found that flow can enhance performance in a wide variety of areas including teaching, learning, athletics, and artistic creativity.
    Flow can also lead to further learning and skill development. Because the act of achieving flow indicates a substantial mastery of a certain skill, the individual must continually seek new challenges and information in order to maintain this state.



## What is attention 



According to eminent psychologist and philosopher William James, attention

"is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what may seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. …It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others."—"The Principles of Psychology," 1890

### Anatomy 

Attention is limited. There has been a tremendous amount of research looking at exactly how many things we can attend to and for how long. Researchers have found that key variables that impact our ability to stay on task include how interested we are in the stimulus and how many distractors we experience. Studies have demonstrated that attention is limited in terms of both capacity and duration. The illusion that attention is limitless has led many people to practice multitasking. It's only in recent years that research has pointed out how multitasking seldom works well because our attention is, in reality, limited.


## Summary Attention
For the most part, our ability to focus our attention on one thing while blocking out competing distractors seems automatic. Yet the ability of people to selectively focus their attention on a specific subject while dismissing others is very complex.
