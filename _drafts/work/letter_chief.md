I loved sendbox from the day of my interview, also you highlited your diligence and knowledge about the field. 
I needed somewhere where I could be self-restrained and improve my craft, sometimes i get lost in creativity and thoughts. A major goal for me this year is improving my focus level and discipline, I've come to learn that everyday is not a bed of rose, neither is it a smooth sail. 

Please know that while I am at Sendbox, I do have the best interest of the company at heart and stretch my capacity to represent us very well. 

I may not be perfect, tbh the codebase sometimes still confuses me, and at times I query myself and ask If I am good enough for the position or not?
My spare time is focused on learning with the materials that cover these path, I understand that it will not be instant, but I am trying my best. 

PS: I have strengths in roles that are visually demanding and creative, vague and challenging.
