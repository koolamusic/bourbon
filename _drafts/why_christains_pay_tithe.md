This is a three bedroom flat fully furnished, a MAster bedroom and two junior bedrooms.
I got the access to the building, after accepting to work for the master, 



Malachi
I will open the windows of heaven (the windows of heaven are already open)
Then He will pour out his blessing (Now you receive some)

But then people have forgotten about the Devourers, so you pay your tithe and he rebukes the devourers(hospital bills, robbery, scam, tariff)
It is not by your power that you do not spend your money on issues that do not matter. 



Christians as stated in Ephesians : You are seated in christ in heavenly places. 
So this means you now have access to this 3 Bedroom flat fully furnished, so why do you need to tithe, 
Why you need to honour the master again, there are other rooms In this flat you do not have access to, 
Honouring the master gives you access to the keys, or maybe you are trying to get the larger picture;

This is your own way of showing you are a responsible son, for out of what the master has blessed you with, 
You are now supporting the store house, with money to pump water, buy foodstuff for the kitchen, and when the 
master blesses you more, you bring in more tithe for the maintenance of the house, foodstuff, AC, DSTV subscription
and other premium, you are now a responsible son, you have unlocked access into the heart of the father and proven that you are willing to 
take responsibility, so the father gives you a much bigger office to manages knowing fully well that this elevation will bring more to the house. 

For the unbeliever, paying your tithe is like the politician who comes to seek for favour and you get blessing from the windows. and the devourers who are outside 
will not be able to eat you up, as christains we already have covering from the devourers.
