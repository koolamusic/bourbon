So you like him or she seems adorable. 

They say never date a coworker. 

Ask yourself ..  which is more valuable she or the job ?
Who can you live without ?

Sometimes we might be lucky and get bothl but more importatnly live by these rules. 


- No open affection 

- Let the Boss/ or HOD know about it 

- No conlfict of interests or bias.

- Emotional excesses should be curtailed.

- Be mature and responsive (this can mean a lot of things and is ambiguos)
