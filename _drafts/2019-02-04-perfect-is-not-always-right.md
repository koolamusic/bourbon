Today i decided I was going to clean up the whole house, room, bathroom, kitchen and parlor. As it may happen; sublimely I spent 3 hours in the kitchen unintentionally
when it dawned on me; I asked why ? I discovered I wanted everything thing spanky clean. 

MERIT 
DEMERIT


This was the same scenario yesterday at work, I was given a codebase to analyze and understand, so that i could implement a new feature, be it as it may I spent a lot of time going through each line of code, what classes were used, all dependencies and how it was utilized, and when ,y time was up, 
it dawned on me that the aim wasn't to know everything every damn detail at the moment, I just needed to know how the veins were coupled, with the libraries and utils, So i could create my new feature; This is valuable when contributing to an open source codebase. The reason people are overwhelmed is because they think they need to understand everything. No you don't silly 

Which aspects of your life had you been a victim to Over-perfection; don't mind sharing 

P.S: After I realized this, I cleaned up the whole house within the next 45 minutes.

Whether you like or not, only 20% of the Detergent you apply on your clothe will remove that dent on the neck of your shirt, the rest just get into the fold, so also you should find the 80/20 narrative to your current workflow.


So mmore likely ask yourself what 20% of the overall chunk of this task can I work on[THESARUS] to seemingly achieve a status or Work Done, note that the definition of done should be known and the results to be achieved from a status of DONE should be clear.
