Workplace Journal: Guidelines for success in organizations

Rule 1:
Be Good at what you do

Do you know what you are doing?
What skill and competency level is required to do business in your field?

The first element of any successful business, employee role or management position is expertise because, without it, you're going to crumble

In other words, are you comfortable and confident in your knowledge within that field?

Take for example:

A graphic or logo designer, this does not mean you have to attend the best graphic design school or take the best courses and receive the best certifications in graphic design.
What this means is that you have a firm grasp of your skills, your industry, the tools which you require to get work done and a broad understanding of the requirements of any design task.

Identify your strengths and weaknesses and intentionally work on the areas you want to be known for; if you want to be recommended as a UI UX Expert, Software Developer, Communications Expert etc. You have to dig deep into the requirements for these roles, match them against your strengths and weaknesses and polish them up.
