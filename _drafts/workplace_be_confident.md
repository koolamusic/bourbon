- Speak well 
  The idea here is that you communicate well, speak well means your words are clear enough to pass your message, this is not about having an american accent, or blowing 
  a lot of grammer like Professor Patrick, speak well means that when you open your mouth to speak, your voice can drive attention and communication can be clear.

- Write well

  In your communication, not everyone in your workplace deserves your attention, with work related stuff, sure you can talk but limit the laughter, jest and mockery, you can listen and laugh a little does not mean you should try making your own jokes or jests.
  

- If you derive a high self esteem from the way you look, its also important that you dress well too.
