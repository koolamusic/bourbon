Hi I am Andrew, I cofounded Tecmie, Wootivmedia, which are Digital Branding and Consulting services targeted at different markets.

I created teta.africa to target developers, [developers don't pay] esp in Nigeria, parents haven't caught to the trend of capacity development yet.

I created the Missing Persons Archive to help with the tracking of information for Missing Person.

During the Nigerian Elections, I created an election MESSENGER aggregation bot that received over 5k subscribers, within a day. I think I started late.

--- I created stateman.org project to aggregate data about politicians within the country ---

I founded LetterToMyLove during the valentines, we received over 100 orders and fulfilled through our on-demand delivery service

I founded blogmazine, because I love art and Design.
MEST is my opportunity to stretch out my capacity and build out something outstanding with a team of the most brilliant individuals ever in Africa.

I do believe this is a wonderful time to be alive.
